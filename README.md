# QSORT

QSORT(Quick Simple Online and Realtime Tracking) is a simple online and realtime tracking algorithm for 2D multiple object tracking in video sequences. It is much faster than [SORT(Simple Online and Realtime Tracking)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.00763). But its performance is a little worse than SORT.

# What is different from SORT?

QSORT is SORT skipping the Kalman Filter.
